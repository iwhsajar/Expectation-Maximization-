# Expectation-Maximization-
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is defined as the combination of various unsupervised machine learning algorithms, which is used to determine the local maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) or maximum a posteriori estimates (MAP) for unobservable variables in statistical models.
It is working of Expectation Maximization algorithm on approach of performing maximum likelihood estimation.
